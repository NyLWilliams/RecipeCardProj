<h3><bold>Steps</bold></h3>
    <ul>
        <ol>Instructions
            <li>Start by grating both blocks of your sharp cheddar cheese into a bowl and set aside in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Lightly grease your aluminum pan with some of your butter.</li>
            <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil, add a little bit of olive oil or vegetable oil and salt to the pot to prevent noodles from sticking together. Once water is at a boil add macaroni noodles.</li>
            <li>Make sure to watch noodles closely and stir. Once they've reached "al-dente", remove the noodles from heat and drain them.</li>
            <li>Once noodles have cooled down a little bit combine the noodles, 3 whole eggs, salt, pepper, and 6-8 slices butter to the large bowl.</li>
            <li>As you combine these ingredients, use a large spoon to mix everything together.</li>
            <li>Slowly add your whole milk to the mixture. The milk and eggs, help to add some density and flavor to the mix.</li>
            <li>After you've mixed everything together, you want to put a thin layer or noodles in the bottom of the aluminum pan, once it's spread evenly, start sprinkling in the sharp cheddar cheese and mexican blend. Making sure each layer has an even amount of cheese.</li>
            <li>Once you've layered your pan, with the noodles and cheese evenly distributed. Add a little more black pepper and salt on top, with another layer of cheese.</li>
            <li>Lastly, spread a few slices of butter on top, this ensures a nice golden brown color on the top.</li>
            <li>Wrap the pan in plastic wrap and aluminum foil, to ensure a thorough cook, keep both on for about 30 mins. Remove plastic wrap and foil to let bake for a final 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Let cool a bit before serving.</li>
        </ol>
